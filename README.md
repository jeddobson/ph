Dartmouth Name Directory Utilities

These Python scripts query the Dartmouth LDAP directory and function as a 
primitive phonebook ('ph'--the name is taken from an old Harvard utility) 
application. The 'dl' script queries for departmental ('department list')
information to list staff, faculty, student, alum, and sponsored accounts.
